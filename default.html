			<h1>About Me</h1>
	  	<p>
				I am a product designer focusing on UX, UI, and front-end design for web and mobile apps. I believe that designing a great solution requires a thorough understanding of the problem and the best way to come to that understanding is by getting to know your users and their process.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the last eight years, I have worked many roles for a variety of teams and products - from leading a support/front-end web design team through defining requirements as a business analyst to acting as product owner for web and iOS app developers. This experience has put me in a position to understand what it takes to deliver a product that does what is necessary to succeed.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="process">
			<h1>Process</h1>
			<p>
				The tools depend on the job, and knowing when to use the correct tool is a skill in itself. My toolbox is constantly expanding, but regardless of the job, I have a clear process for designing a solution: strategy, research and analysis, design, and iteration.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="card-wrap">
			<div class="card">
				<h1>Strategy</h1>
				<p>
					I strive to understand why something is needed before anything else. I understand that a product cannot be all things to all people and that a clear product vision is essential to success. To get there, I’ll create personas, vision statements, key functions and characteristic tradeoffs, mood boards, and affinity diagrams.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h1>Research & Analysis</h1>
				<p>
					The next step is to gather and digest any useful data that will inform the direction to take the solution. This includes user stories, business requirements, stakeholder interviews, current and future state analysis, process maps, system context diagrams, and site maps.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h1>Design</h1>
				<p>
					The really fun stuff - this is where I take all of the information I've gathered and start producing ideas. These can be in the form of sketches, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
				<h1>Iterate</h1>
				<p>
					It is rare to achieve perfection on the first try. Whether it is through reviews and feedback from my teammates or clients and users, the most important step is to review and revise. This includes review meetings, user acceptance testing, and retrospectives.
				</p>
